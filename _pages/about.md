# Hi! I'm Elita ðŸ‘‹
I am an active third-year undergraduate student majoring in Information Systems with a growing interest in working with data and learning how it can help people make better decisions.

Currently, I am joining the Coding Camp 2025 powered by DBS Foundation on Machine Learning Engineer, gaining hands-on experience in data analysis, modeling, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn.

 Iâ€™m now seeking internship or entry-level opportunities where I can apply my skills, gain hands-on experience, and continue learning in a professional setting.
